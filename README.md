## Overview
It is common for politicians to make promises to the public as a way of campaigning for office and attempting to gain the support of voters. These promises can cover a wide range of issues, from policy positions to specific initiatives or programs that the politician plans to implement if elected. However, it is also not uncommon for politicians to fail to follow through on their promises once they are in power.

There are a number of reasons why politicians might fail to deliver on their promises. One reason is that the demands and realities of governing can be very different from what was anticipated during the campaign. Politicians may find that it is more difficult to implement their ideas or policies than they had anticipated, or that they face unforeseen obstacles or resistance.

Another reason is that politicians may make promises that are simply unrealistic or unsustainable. In the heat of a campaign, it can be tempting to make grandiose promises that are not feasible in the long term, in order to appeal to voters. Once in office, these politicians may find that they are unable to follow through on these promises, either because of a lack of resources or political support.

Finally, some politicians may simply be more interested in getting elected than in fulfilling their promises once in office. They may make promises that they have no intention of keeping in order to win votes, and then neglect to follow through on those promises once they are in power.

In summary, it is not uncommon for politicians to make promises as a way of campaigning for office, but it is also not uncommon for these promises to go unfulfilled once the politicians are in power. There are a number of reasons why this can happen, including the demands and realities of governing, unrealistic or unsustainable promises, and a lack of commitment to following through on campaign promises.

It is understandable to feel frustrated and disillusioned when politicians make false promises or fail to follow through on their campaign promises. This can lead to a lack of trust in the political process and a feeling of cynicism towards politicians in general.

One reason why politicians may make false promises is because they are trying to appeal to as many voters as possible in order to win an election. In the heat of a campaign, it can be tempting for politicians to make grandiose promises in order to gain support, even if they are not realistic or achievable.

Another reason why politicians may make false promises is because they may not fully understand the complexity of an issue or may not have a plan in place to actually follow through on their promise. It is important for politicians to carefully consider the consequences of their promises and to be honest with voters about what they can and cannot do.

Ultimately, it is important for voters to hold politicians accountable for their promises. This can be done by actively participating in the political process, researching candidates and their stances on issues, and holding politicians accountable through the voting process. It is also important for politicians to be transparent and honest with voters about their motivations and what they can realistically achieve.

Design for a web system to keep politicians accountable for their promises:
The system would have a database of promises made by politicians. These promises could be entered manually by users or could be automatically collected from public statements made by politicians.
Each promise would have a status indicating whether it has been fulfilled, is in progress, or has not yet been started.
Users of the system would be able to search for promises by politician, by keyword, or by status.
The system would provide a way for users to report on the progress of a promise, such as by providing updates or evidence of fulfillment.
The system would also allow politicians to provide updates on the progress of their promises or to explain why a promise has not yet been fulfilled.
The system could also provide tools for tracking the performance of politicians over time, such as by displaying graphs showing the percentage of promises fulfilled or by calculating an overall "promise fulfillment score" for each politician.

To ensure the accuracy and impartiality of the information on the system, it could be moderated by a team of independent fact-checkers.
Overall, the goal of this system would be to provide a transparent and accountable way for politicians to track and report on the promises they have made to the public.
